-4   prevent non-picture files in report (helps preventing malware/infected files from being extracted and saved on the hard disk)
-5   prevent hash computation and hash database use*
-6   prevent container creation (keeps users from creating and filling containers themselves)
-7   prevent directory browser hide context menu (does not affect search hit list context menu)*
-8   prevent advanced general options
-9   prevent security options dialog

-11  prevent refine volume snapshot scope options
-12  prevent last window arrangement reload (affects initialization only)
-13  prevent directory browser columns type status and *internal ID
-14  prevent relative offset search hit column (affects initialization only)
